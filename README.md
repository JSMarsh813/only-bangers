<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![screenshot of the website that shows filters to the left and posts to the right](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56e0cdeb-aba0-4641-abed-c74123602ab1)

The inspiration behind this project:

- Problem: Your private list of resources can easily get unweildly and its hard to find specific resources quickly

  - Solution: Tag system allows you to sort through shared resources by tags

- Problem: You vaguely remember a video somewhere talked about a certain subject, like networking on twitter. But just the idea of clicking on several videos and finding that specific section is exhausting. So you use up all your energy hunting down that resource instead of networking or whatever else you intended to do.

  - Solution: Share video or podcast resources with specific timestamps for specific topics. So you can use tags to find what video and at what time that topic comes up.

- Problem: Community members often share "banger" public resources in discords or threads, however those links tend to get swallowed up over time
  - Solution: As long as the resources are tagged correctly, they'll no longer be lost to time

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

ðŸŸ¢ Overall logic for filtering, viewing, creating, editing and deleting posts:

- [x] Feat: Add and show posts
- [x] Feat: Filtering system
- [x] Feat: Auth system/ Login and registration pages
- [x] Feat: Reset password link
- [x] Feat: Likes
- [x] Feat: Flag system to alert for concerning content, or to suggest edits
- [x] Feat: SWR for posts (so posts automatically refresh during actions like edits, deletions or when you manually request to check for new items)
- [x] Feat: add clipboard feature for url links
- [x] Feat: Automatically check if a video url is embeddeable, if not do not show. This avoids the "firefox cannot open this page" alert
- [ ] Feat: convert heavily used sites video urls to embedded versions automatically (youtube, linkedIn, instagram, ect)

ðŸŸ¢ For Dashboard/ User settings

- [x] Feat: Dashboard where users can view liked posts and edit posts they submitted
- [x] Feat: Swr added to dashboard (for liked and submitted posts)
- [ ] Feat: Create settings page so users can change their username, password, or profile image
- [ ] Enhancement: improve the delay for checking user's logged in information
- [ ] Enhancement: Allow logged in users to stay on the login or register page if they chose to but disable the form and show an alert

ðŸŸ¢ Progress for specific sections:

- [x] Feat: General Resources Page
- [x] Feat: Dashboard Page
- [x] Feat: Landing Page
- [ ] Feat: AI resources section
- [ ] Feat: Technical resources section
- [ ] Feat: Community resources section

See the [open issues](https://github.com/JSMarsh813/only-bangers/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

<!-- Solved Problems -->

### Solved Problems

âœ… 1. Cannot query appwrite to get documents based on the post's tags, because we cannot query based on relationship fields (fields that link from one document to another)
Link to the docs about this: https://appwrite.io/docs/products/databases/relationships#queries

- Solution: Manually filter through the nested data structure
- Use state to keep track of the changing data
- The logic has changed slightly with the implementation of SWR for data management, but I have elected to keep the original code below as it covers the core logic:

```
  // store the posts we get from the server in state
    const [posts, setPosts] = useState([...initialPosts]);

 // store the tags the user wants to filter by
   const [tagFilters, setFiltersState] = useState([]);

// render these filtered posts
  const [filteredPosts, setFilteredPosts] = useState([]);

//
```

Update the array of filtered tags if the user adds or removes tags

```
 //adding or removing filters that we're looking for

const handleFilterChange = (e) => {
  const { value, checked } = e.target;
  checked
    ? setFiltersState([...tagFilters, value])
    : setFiltersState(tagFilters.filter((tag) => tag != value));
};
```

       * useEffect will run everytime in the dependecy array runs: tagFilters, posts

       So it will run if:
       1. our intial posts from the server change or
       2. the user adds or removes tags to filter by

```
useEffect(() => {
  let currenttags = tagFilters;

  setFilteredPosts(

    // filter is iterating over every object
    posts.filter((object) =>

        // we are filtering based on the tags, every tag needs to return yes, I am inside this object/post's tags
        // so currenttags goes first

        currenttags.every((tag) =>

                //But first we need to trim the object down to just tag names
               //object.tags trim each object so they just have their tags property with an array of tag objects

              object.tags.map((tag) =>

                   // use map to then trim each tag object in the array to just its tag_names property

                   tag.tag_name)

                           //now we can see if the tag from tagFilters is in this tags array
                           // if the array has the tag, filter returns true so the post is not filtered out
                           // otherwise filter returns false, so the post is filtered out

                           .includes(tag),
        ),
      //
    ),
  );
}, [tagFilters, posts]);

```

âœ… 2. I noticed I was not getting my entire list of tags back. I found out appwrite defaults list documents to return 25 documents unless otherwise specified

- edited the query limit to 5000 so we can get all the tags
- thread which discussed this: https://appwrite.io/threads/1201609088421867680

```
 export async function GET(request) {
 //   const sessionCookie = cookies().get("session");

 try {
   const { documents: tagList } = await databases.listDocuments(
     process.env.DATABASE_ID,
     process.env.COLLECTION_TAGS,
     [Query.limit(5000)],
   );
   return Response.json({ tagList });

 } catch (error) {
   console.error("ERROR", error);
   return Response.json("error", {
     message: "An error occured!",
   });
 }
}

```

âœ… 3. Avoid private information from being unintentionally shared / Its vital to maintain the cozy private atmosphere of technical community spaces

- Added a checkbox saying the user agrees the content meets community guidelines (only sharing public content)

- Require that each post have a url, to ensure each is publically shared content

- Add a flag report form & database so users can notify us about content which does that not meet community guidelines or suggest edits to the posts (ex: suggesting additional tags)

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- CONCERNS -->

### Concerns To Solve

1. Avoid duplicate content:

- Multiple posts can be about different sections of the same peice of content, like a video. Which is exactly what we want. However, someone can reshare that specific clip/section of the content unintentionally

- 1a: Potential Solution 1: Add a database which links urls to specific posts. So when a user creates a post, it will look up if that url exists and then add the posts id to it, to link the two databases.

  - Con: This would require extra database requests

  - Con: More complexity

  - Con: how to normalize the url since some

- 1b Possible Solution 2: Run a function to delete everything after a "?" to get the raw url without any queries?

  - Con: Sites give different versions of a url

  - 1c. Possible Solution 3: for sites that this is a known issue, run a function to check if its the version of the url we want (aka a youtube link with share added so it can be embedded)

  - Overall: this is possible, but is all that added complexity worth it just to avoid duplicated data?

- 1d. Potential Solution 4: in the flag report, add a way for users to notify us about potentially duplicated content

  - con: would have to manually check

  - pro: avoids the extra code complexity

- 1e. Potential Solution 5: when adding new content, allow users to query for created posts that have a specific url (and the resources starting time if its a video/podcast)

  - con: most users aren't going to want to manually check

  - pro: but would be appreciated by some users

  - con: extra coding logic/complexity, especially if we incorporate the time. How many seconds do we decide is close enough to the given starting time, for a post to qualify as a potential duplicate?
